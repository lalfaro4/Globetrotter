            Greetings! My name is Taylor and I am the lead for Team 2. Currently, I am in my senior year of Computer Engineering at SFSU and will be finishing my Bachelors degree this Fall as well as starting a masters program in Embedded Systems. When I am not in school, I work with my dad doing IT support for hotels in SoCal which I find can be just as fun as engineering or coding. Other than that I enjoy cooking, playing LoL, practicing foreign languages, and being outdoors.
