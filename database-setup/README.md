# Database Setup
There are two files in here. One is a database model which currently only has one table 'users'. Using this model I exported the second file which is a script used to create the database schema based on the model.

You can install MySQL on your local computer and run the script using MySQL workbench. Then you can test the API endpoints from api.js using Postman.
